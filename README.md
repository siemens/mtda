# Overview

Multi-Tenant Device Access (or MTDA for short) is a relatively small Python application
acting as an interface to a test device. It provides mechanisms to remotely turn the
device on or off (assuming an IP/USB power switch is available), plug USB devices in
or out (also requiring special hardware) or simply access its console (in most cases
serial).

The following images illustrate two setup configurations.

Raspberry Pi 4 setup (Recommended):

> [!NOTE]  
> Raspberry Pi 4 is recommended due to its modern architecture, better CPU, more RAM, USB 3.0 ports, gigabit ethernet making it 
> more suitable for MTDA.
