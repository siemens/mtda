Introduction
============

Mentor Test Device Agent (or MTDA for short) is a relatively small Python application
acting as an interface to a test device. It provides mechanisms to remotely turn the
device on or off (assuming an IP/USB power switch is available), plug USB devices in
or out (also requiring special hardware) or simply access its console (in most cases
serial).
