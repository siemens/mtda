Configuration
=============

MTDA will attempt to read the following configuration files (and in that
order):

 * ``/etc/mtda/config``
 * ``/etc/mtda/config.d/*.conf``
 * ``$HOME/.mtda/config``

Most recently loaded configuration items take precedence over others. This
allows a regular user to override system defaults.

Configuration files are similar to whatâ€™s found in Microsoft Windows INI
files (Python's `configparser` module is used to parse them).

It is possible to override some settings using environment variables.

General settings
----------------

* ``main``: section [optional]
    Usually placed at the top of MTDA configuration files. It contains general
    settings.

      debug messages off).

  * ``fuse``: boolean [optional]
      Enable support for mounting partitions from the shared device using FUSE
      instead of ``losetup`` and ``mount``. This feature is experimental and
      requires ``partitionfs``, ``fuseext2`` and ``fusefat``.

  * ``name``: string [optional]

* ``ui``: section [optional]
  User Interface settings for the console. This is relevant only for MTDA clients.

  * ``prefix``: string [optional]
      Change the key prefix to control the interactive MTDA console. The default
      prefix is ``ctrl-a`` (which is also used by the ``screen`` tool, this
      setting may be used to use e.g. ``ctrl-b`` instead).

* ``console``: section [optional]
    Specify console settings when running the agent-side of MTDA (this section
    is ignored when running MTDA as a client). The ``variant`` key should be
    set, other settings in this section are variant-specific.

  * ``variant``: string [required]

      and ``telnet``.

* ``keyboard``: section [optional]
    Specify a keyboard driver.

    ``variant`` key should be set, other settings in this section are
    variant-specific.

  * ``variant``: string [required]
      Select a console variant. MTDA provides the following drivers: ``serial``
      and ``telnet``.

      ``0`` for a dynamic port assignment).

  * ``host``: string [optional]
      Remote host name or ip to connect to as a client to interact with the
      MTDA agent (defaults to ``localhost``).

* ``scripts``: section [optional]
    Python scripts to be executed upon certain events. Use ``... `` instead of

          ... mtda.monitor_send(" ")
          ... mtda.monitor_send("run bootcmd_mmc0\n")

      This sample script would instruct MTDA to wait for the ``Hit any key to
