Configuration
=============

MTDA will reads it configuration from:

 * $HOME/.mdta/config
 * /etc/mtda/config

Configuration files are similar to what’s found in Microsoft Windows INI
files (Python's `configparser` module is used to parse them).

It is possible to override some settings using environment variables.

Configuration reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``main``: [optional]
    Usually placed at the top of MTDA configuration files. It contains general
    settings.

  * ``debug``: integer [optional]
      Level of debug messages to print out while running (set to 0 to turn all
      debug messages off).

  * ``fuse``: boolean [optional]
      Enable support for mounting partitions from the shared device using FUSE
      instead of ``losetup`` and ``mount``. This feature is experimental and
      requires ``partitionfs``, ``fuseext2`` and ``fusefat``.

* ``console``: [optional]
    Specify console settings when running the agent-side of MTDA (this section
    is ignored when running MTDA as a client). The ``variant`` key should be
    set, other settings in this section are variant-specific.

  * ``variant``: string [required]
      Select a console variant. MTDA provides the following drivers: ``serial``
      and ``telnet``.

* ``remote``: [optional]
    Specify the host and ports to connect to when using a MTDA client (such as
    ``mtda-cli``).

  * ``control``: integer [optional]
      Remote port listening for control commands (defaults to ``5556``).

  * ``console``: integer [optional]
      Remote port to connect to in order to get console messages (defaults to
      ``5557``).

  * ``host``: string [optional]
      Remote host name or ip to connect to as a client to interact with the
      MTDA agent (defaults to ``localhost``).
